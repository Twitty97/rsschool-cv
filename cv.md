### **About myself**

I am a young and enthusiastic web-developer looking for an opportunity to grow my skillset by completing RS-School Front-end development course. 

I have spent some time thinking which stack / ecosystem will work for me best and eventually decided to chose frontend since I am a visual thinker and I think in visual components rather than abstract concepts.
